## Who am i

I am a computer professional with 3+ years of experience that really loves what I do, proficient in agile
practices(SCRUM, Kanban), passionate for design and web development. I ́m detailed oriented software
engineer(key in any application). I really enjoy the challenges and I work hard increasing my knowledge constantly.

I have worked with different technologies, such as HTML5, CSS3(SASS/LESS), JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Angularjs,
Gulp, NPM, Bower, Git, PHP, MySQL, Java, testing strategies such as TDD or BDD, and I have worked in different roles,
like Front-End, Back-End and UI/UX designer. Also I have hands on experience with automated testing tools(Selenium,
Protractor, Fitnesse, Cucumber), continuous integration(Bamboo), and prototyping tools(Sketch, Balsamiq, UXpin,
Invision).

I’m a dedicated programmer-gamer. I have it on my DNA. It’s what I love to do and it’s what I’m good at. I’m creative,
good team player, fair play and ethical values are the core of my existence. I’m sure there will be achievements to
accomplish, and probably I won’t know exactly what to do in the beginning, but i just know how to make things done
regardless of what I must learn the journey.

Besides programming and gaming, I love cooking, listening to music, going to the movies, board gaming, as well as
playing and modelling miniatures: I am particularly fond for steam-punk game called Warmachine and Hordes by Privateer
Press. Currently, I am a press gang member on my country, it’s a volunteer work in which I help spreading the word of
Privateer Press’ work and organise tournaments and demo games among the local(geek) Community.
